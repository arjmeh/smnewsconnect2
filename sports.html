        The Rams didn't actually win Super Bowl 56. According<br />
        to an article by The New York Times, "The Rams touchdown<br />
        was started on a false start, therefore concluding that <br />The Rams
        touchdown shouldn't be counted." (New York Times).<br />
        When the referees zoomed into the footage of the game, they<br />
        could see that Matthew Stafford, The Rams quarterback, <br />was 2.31
        centimeters over the line. But it was too late, the game<br />
        had already ended, and The Rams had been declared champions.<br />
        The Bengals were very angry when they realized this, so <br />they
        tweeted, "We have heard that the Ram's didn't score <br />the touchdown
        ... We are so angry that we are going to <br />shut down the team and
        kick out all of our players." (The Bengals Twitter).
