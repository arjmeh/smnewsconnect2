      <h4 class="text" description: China has run out of trees>
        China has been thriving in the economy in the past few years.<br />
        But ever since the carbon emissions in China have increased,<br />
        many trees have been dying. Almost 4.5 billion trees have died<br />
        in China, and the tree population is still decreasing rapidly. A
        researcher<br />
        at The University of China has reported, "After exploring China, we
        have<br />
        realized that only 800 trees are remaining in the country." (Randy
        Jones). <br />People will have to leave China because there won't be
        enough trees, <br />said a reporter from CNN. Many residents of China
        have had to migrate to<br />
        another country forcefully by the government but were given
        compensation<br />
        to upwards of 50 thousand U.S. dollars. A former Chinese citizen<br />
        was interviewed and stated that he was, "Angry when I was given a
        notice<br />
        by government officials saying that I had to move to a different
        place."

      <h4 class="text" description: Farting is banned in florida>You can't fart in public in Florida. After a child farted<br> in front of David Samson, the whole of Florida was in shock.<br> The fart smelled so bad that David couldn't breathe and <br>had to get away from the child. After some searching,<br> government officials found the child who did this crime.<br> Ever since then, farting has been banned in public in Florida.<br> If you fart in public, you could be sentenced to community<br> service for a month or even be arrested if the fart induces<br> agony. Thousands of people don't know about this rule<br> in Florida and are in danger. If things go wrong and they fart,<br> it could be over.</h4>

      <img src="lawsuit.jpeg" alt="lawsuit" style="border-radius: 10px;">
      <h4 class="text">Apple is closing down after a lawsuit with Microsoft. <br>Apple was given a copyright claim for copying one of Microsoft's <br>products: Microsoft Word. Apple developed Apple Word, an<br> almost identical replica of Microsoft Word. After a few months, Microsoft employee <br>Jen Stevenson found out that Apple was copying Microsoft. <br>She quickly filed a copyright claim with the Washington Police and immediately<br> caught Apple's attention. Tim Cook tried to fight with the lawyer<br> but immediately realized that he wouldn't win. He was devasted<br> when the lawyer sent him to jail and forced Apple to shut down<br> on March 1, 2022. Many people try to justify what Apple did but<br> the lawyer did not get Tim a bail. Tim Cook said that he would try <br>to start a new company called Orange, but he is in jail<br> for the next seven years so he can't. If you have an Apple product,<br> the warranty will expire, and the product will stop working in 21 days.</h4>
